While many online learning quality rubrics do exist, thus far there has been little empirical evidence establishing a clear link between specific course design features and concrete, student-level course outcomes. In the current study, the authors develop an online course design assessment rubric that includes four areas, and explore the impact of each area on student end-of-semester performance in 23 online courses at two community colleges. The results indicate that the quality of interpersonal interaction within a course relates positively and significantly to student grades. Additional analyses based on course observation and interview data suggest that frequent and effective student-instructor interaction creates an online environment that encourages students to commit themselves to the course and perform at a stronger academic level. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Many research studies have been carried out and important findings have been made, but there has not yet been a large scale survey to try and ‘map’ the state of the art in telecollaboration practice. Most studies focus on single telecollaboration projects and look at the project design, learning outcomes and difficulties teachers and researchers have encountered in that particular project. This paper reports on a survey which sought to explore current practices and attitudes towards telecollaboration across European universities and to identify barriers that practitioners encounter. The survey was completed in full by a total of 210 university language teachers in 23 different European countries and 131 students. The picture we found presents a broad spectrum of practices. Despite an overwhelmingly positive attitude towards telecollaboration, findings also provide large-scale confirmation of some of the problems identified in small-scale studies, such as organizational difficulties, lack of time, limited technical support and great uncertainty regarding issues students should address in their exchanges. The paper concludes with some recommendations as to how to meet these challenges and how telecollaboration practice could become mainstreamed in higher education. © Francesca Helm.",Collaborative learning; Computer-Assisted language learning; Computer-mediated communication; Telecollaboration,

Smith E.E.,“A real double-edged sword:” Undergraduate perceptions of social media in their learning,2016,Computers and Education,18,10.1016/j.compedu.2016.09.009,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84988719560&doi=10.1016%2fj.compedu.2016.09.009&partnerID=40&md5=aaaa39fb8f4bdb221850421fcd935058,"This study investigates undergraduate perceptions of the social media technologies (SMTs) they use in their learning. This mixed methods inquiry employed 30 semi-structured interviews and an online survey (N = 679) to explore why and how undergraduates from across disciplines view SMTs to be a meaningful part of their university learning. Findings shed new insights into student perspectives on and uses of social media, and the variety of ways in which undergraduates intentionally choose (or, choose not) to incorporate social media into their university learning in meaningful ways. Student perceptions formed an overarching theme of social media as a double-edged sword that both informs and distracts, having the potential to both help and hinder learning. Together, the interviews and the open-ended survey results demonstrate that several contextual relationships exist, underscoring the importance of considering affordances of social media for learning. Rather than taking an approach founded upon technological determinism, learning context and social media affordances become key. Undergraduate perceptions of educational interactions via social media illustrate the prominence of student-student and student-content, rather than faculty-student, interactions via social media in their learning, allowing for an updated understanding of previous educational interactions models. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Computer-mediated communication; Media in education; Post-secondary education,Education; Education computing; Engineering education; Social networking (online); Surveys; Computer mediated communication; Contextual relationships; Media in education; Postsecondary education; Semi structured interviews; Student perceptions; Student perspectives; Technological determinism; Students

Playing a specific role within a group could lead students to exercise collective cognitive responsibility for collaborative knowledge building. Two studies explored the relationship of role taking to participation in a blended university course. Students participated in the same knowledge-building activity over three consecutive, five-week modules and enacted four roles designed in alignment with knowledge building pedagogy (Scardamalia and Bereiter 2010). In Study 1, 59 students were distributed into groups with two conditions: students who took a role in Module 2 and students who did not take a role, using Module 1 and 3 as pre and post tests. Results showed no differences in participation in Module 1, higher levels of writing and reading for role takers in Module 2, and this pattern was sustained in Module 3. Students with the Synthesizer role were the most active in terms of writing and the second most active for reading; students with the Social Tutor role were the most active for reading. In Study 2, 143 students were divided into groups with two conditions: students who took a role in Module 1 and students who did not take a role. Content analysis revealed that role takers tended to vary their contributions more than non-role takers by proposing more problems, synthesizing the discourse, reflecting on the process and organization of activity. They also assumed appropriate responsibilities for their role: the Skeptic prioritizes questioning of content, the Synthesizer emphasizes synthesizing of content, and the Social Tutor privileges maintaining of relationships. Implications of designing role taking to foster knowledge building in university blended courses are discussed. © 2015, International Society of the Learning Sciences, Inc.",Computer-mediated communication; Cooperative/collaborative learning; Knowledge building; Pedagogical issues; Post-secondary education; Role taking; Teaching/learning strategies,

New media scholars have coined the term “intensity of Facebook use” (IFU) for the concept that measures the emotional and affective attitude towards Facebook use among young people. IFU is an important service use concept that has been positively linked with the different psychosocial outcomes of student well-being. However, only a limited amount of the prior literature has investigated the relationship between IFU and different Facebook uses and gratifications (U&G). The existing literature suggests inconsistent findings with a sole emphasis on young adults. To address these gaps, the present study has investigated the differential role of different Facebook U&G among adolescents and young adults in predicting IFU. A total of three cross-sectional data sets (N = 373, 107, 105) represented adolescents and university-attending young-adult Facebook users. The study results suggest that process U&G do and content U&G do not play any significant role in predicting IFU. Adolescents and young adults differ in their sought Facebook U&G. In addition to this, cultural differences were observed in the sought Facebook U&G and their differential role in predicting IFU. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Adolescent; Content U&G; Cross-sectional survey; Intensity of Facebook use; Process U&G and young adults,Forecasting; Occupational diseases; Adolescent; Computer mediated communication; Cross-sectional surveys; Cultural difference; Facebook; Uses and gratifications; Young adults; Young peoples; Social networking (online)

Experimental design with pretest-posttest control group was used in the study. Three different learning environment were compared within the scope of the study. Students in Study Group I completed the experimental process using the podcasts supported with reflective thinking activities whilst students in Study Group II completed the process using podcasts which were not supported with reflective thinking activities and students in Study Group III completed the experimental process using web-based videos. The study was carried out for 6 weeks on 103 students studying in a distance education programme of a university. Both qualitative and quantitative data collection techniques were used; and the data was collected using achievement test, social presence perception scale, Instructional Materials Motivation Survey and student opinion identification form. The results of the study revealed that use of podcasts supported with reflective activities were more efficient in ensuring post-test success and motivation, compared to others. In terms of social presence perception, on the other hand, there was no significant difference between study groups. Based on the results of qualitative data analysis, recommendations were made on how to use reflective thinking activities in e-learning environment designs and on how to utilize podcast technology. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, those who think they are capable of multitasking usually overestimate their ability to perform the actual tasks. This study examined university students’ learning performance from the perspectives of their media multitasking self-efficacy, perceived attention problems, and self-regulation strategies using the revised Online Learning Motivated Attention and Regulatory Strategies scale. Participants were 696 university students (275 males, 39.51%) in Taiwan. The author developed the media multitasking self-efficacy scale through open-ended interviews and pilot tested the measures using an exploratory factor analysis. The confirmatory factor analysis verified the uni-factor structure of the instrument. Second-order confirmatory factor analysis validated the two orthogonal higher-order constructs of perceived attention problems and self-regulation strategies as well as their subscales. Results from the multilevel structural equation model revealed significant negative indirect relationship between media multitasking self-efficacy and learning performance via both students’ perceived attention problems and self-regulation strategies. Study findings have implications for prevention and intervention of university students’ media-related attention problems and poor regulation strategy use within the personal learning environment. © 2016",Computer-mediated communication; Interactive learning environments; Learning communities; Media in education; Post-secondary education,Deregulation; Education; Education computing; Factor analysis; Multitasking; Multivariant analysis; Students; Computer mediated communication; Interactive learning environment; Learning community; Media in education; Postsecondary education; Computer aided instruction

This study investigated the effect of facilitating critical thinking using a collaboration script modified from the Questioning, Reading, Answering, and Checking reading strategy (i.e., QRAC-the-Code; Berkeley & Riccomini, 2013) on students' science reading literacy in a computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environment. Participants were 76 college students (71% female) enrolled at a university in central Taiwan. Students were grouped by affinity grouping, where they self-selected their members, and were then randomly assigned to a collaborative learning condition with or without the collaboration script support. Overall, results showed that the collaboration script significantly enhanced students' reading literacy. Moreover, the effect was dependent upon gender and the format of tests. Males benefited more from the collaboration script on constructed-response items whereas females benefited more on multiple-choice items.

It was hypothesized that the strengths of one delivery mode could offset the weaknesses of the other. The purpose of this study was to implement and evaluate an online discussion board intervention designed to scaffold relatedness development. Deci and Ryan's (1985) self-determination theory was adopted as the theoretical framework. Participants were 83 graduate students enrolled in synchronous hybrid Masters of Business Administration (MBA), Masters of Public Administration (MPA), and Masters of Aviation (MS-Avit) programs offered at a large midwestern research university. This study used a convergent parallel mixed methods approach (QUAN + qual = triangulation). The methods involved a pretest-posttest experimental design in which students were randomly assigned to either the experimental group, wherein they participated in the intervention, or the control group, wherein they attended classes without any auxiliary interactions. The results indicated that students who participated in the intervention improved their self-efficacy for developing relatedness with individuals who attended online. The qualitative analysis generated three key themes: relatedness beliefs, program delivery, and student-interface interaction. This study holds practical implications for online learning in that it explicated how a threaded discussion can be used to scaffold relatedness development. The theoretical implications of this study involved the substantiation of three key elements of SDT: the basic needs, the types of motivation, and the importance of contextual support. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Computer-mediated communication; Distance education and telelearning; Distributed learning environments; Post-secondary education,Application programs; Computer aided instruction; Distance education; Distributed computer systems; E-learning; Education; Public administration; Scaffolds; Social networking (online); Business administration; Computer mediated communication; Distance education and tele-learning; Distributed learning environments; Learning environments; Postsecondary education; Self-determination theories; Spontaneous interaction; Students

Traditional lecturing has long focused on instructor-based teaching but now has transitioned to a flipped classroom that emphasizes student learning. In the past, quasi-experimental methods or qualitative interviews were primarily used to explore learners' learning performance, learning satisfaction, and the interaction between teachers and students. Studies on teachers' points of view are rare, as are studies on factors that influence teachers to continue flipped teaching. Thus, the empirical results of this innovative teaching strategy must be assessed to confirm the expectations of practice and theory. Drawing on theories of self-determination and motivation-opportunity-ability, this paper proposes and empirically supports the notion that teachers' motivational factors, perceived self-efficacy, and supportive flipped teaching resources interact to perpetuate flipped teaching in the higher education context. To test the proposed research model, a survey was conducted among 169 university teachers. The results indicate that intrinsic challenge motivation and extrinsic compensation motivation are critical predictors of teachers' continuance use intention for flipped teaching. Perceived self-efficacy was also shown to critically moderate teachers' continuance use intention for flipped teaching. Specifically, when teachers have high perceived self-efficacy, challenge motivation leads to continuance use intention. Conversely, when teachers have low perceived self-efficacy, compensation motivation leads to continuance intention. Further, the results also suggest that teachers’ continuance use intention for flipped teaching is highest when challenge motivation, perceived self-efficacy, and supportive flipped teaching resources are all sufficient and mutually reinforcing. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Computer-mediated communication; Improving classroom teaching; Interactive learning environments; Pedagogical issues; Teaching/learning strategies,Computer aided instruction; Education computing; Learning systems; Motivation; Students; Computer mediated communication; Improving classroom teaching; Interactive learning environment; Pedagogical issues; Teaching/learning strategy; Teaching

Drawbacks of large classes over smaller ones include the reduction of quality student-lecturer interactions, and prevalence of teacher-centered approach to learning. Given these constraints, using mobile messaging apps can ease student-lecturer interactions beyond those attainable in face to face classes. As such, the main proposition of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of using an Interactive Mobile Messaging App (IMMAP) in classrooms of higher education for supporting student-lecturer interactions. The key predictors identified from the Interactive Mobile Messaging Acceptance model were used as a guide to design and develop IMMAP. The predictors are perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, self-efficacy, enjoyment, system quality, information quality, and uncertainty avoidance The pretest-posttest design where participants are studied before and after the experiment concluded was used in this study. Students' perceptions of IMMAP in relation to their adoption intention were obtained using both pretest and posttest surveys. A total of 38 students from two different courses evaluated IMMAP. Findings revealed significant changes on a number of indicators. Uncertainty avoidance level decreased significantly (higher positive score) from pretest to posttest, while system quality increased. In terms of enjoyment, a significant decrease was observed from pretest to posttest. Adoption intention of IMMAP saw a significant increase. The findings reflect students' readiness to use IMMAP in the classrooms to interact with their lecturers. Therefore, investing in the development of mobile messaging apps has the potential to improve the quality of student-lecturer interactions in the classrooms. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Blended learning; Computer-mediated communication; Higher education; Improving classroom teaching; Interactive learning environments,Computer aided instruction; Education; Education computing; Teaching; Blended learning; Computer mediated communication; Higher education; Improving classroom teaching; Interactive learning environment; Students

This study attempts to examine whether flipped classroom, with reference to self-regulation principles, is a good pedagogy for enhancing formative learning outcomes for first year university students. A total of 73 students, enrolled on a teacher education program, participated in this study. Data were collected from different sources in three phases. In the first phase, data were collected from pre- and post-tests, and the number of viewings of the assigned online videos were logged. Techniques in editing images applied by the group and the individual were examined in the second phase. Finally, opinions related to flipped classroom were collected from focus group interviews in the third phase. The results suggest that students are able to apply their self-learned knowledge to editing images both together and individually. They were very positive about flipped classroom activities and all 7 self-regulated (SR) learning principles were achieved. While students embraced the flexibility of learning online, they missed the face-to-face interaction with the teacher and their learning peers. This was especially the case when they did not understand the content of the online videos. This study provides an additional lens of SR principles. © 2018",Computer-mediated communication; Improving classroom teaching; Post-secondary education; Teaching/learning strategies,Deregulation; Teaching; Computer mediated communication; Face-to-face interaction; Flipped classrooms; Improving classroom teaching; Postsecondary education; Teacher education; Teaching/learning strategy; University students; Students

A sense of community, defined as feelings of closeness within a social group, is vital to retention, but few studies have explored how online doctoral students create community. Background In this qualitative case study, I explore how students in one online doctoral program created a learning community. Methodology Data for the study was drawn from 60 hours of video footage from six online courses, the message boards from the six courses, and twenty interviews with first and second-year students. Contribution Findings from this study indicate that the structure of the social network in an online doctoral program is significantly different from the structure of learning communities in face-To-face programs. In the online program, the doctoral community was more insular, more peer-centered, and less reliant on faculty support than in in-person programs. Findings Utilizing a nested communities theoretical framework, I identified four subgroups that informed online doctoral students' sense of community: cohort, class groups, small peer groups, and study groups. Students interacted frequently with members of each of the aforementioned social groups and drew academic, social, and emotional support from their interactions. Recommendations for Practitioners Data from this study suggests that online doctoral students are interested in making social and academic connections. Practitioners should leverage technology and on-campus supports to promote extracurricular interactions for online students. Recommendation for Researchers Rather than focus on professional socialization, students in the online doctoral community were interested in providing social and academic support to peers. Researchers should consider how socialization in online doctoral programs differs from traditional, face-To-face programs. Impact on Society As universities increase online offerings, it is important to consider the issues that impact retention in online programs. By identifying the social structures that support online community, this study helps build knowledge around retention and engagement of online students. Future Research Future research should continue to explore the unique social networks that support online students.",Cohort; Community; Online learning; Social network; Socialization; Virtual classrooms,

The current study examined the outcomes of disclosing stigmatized group membership (i.e., being gay or lesbian) earlier (vs. later) in a developing online relationship. Heterosexuals (n = 214) engaged in an experimentally controlled closeness-inducing online interaction with an ostensible partner, learning that he/she was gay/lesbian either before (i.e., earlier) or after (i.e., later) the interaction. Earlier (vs. later) discovery led to a subjectively more positive contact experience, which predicted heightened bond with the partner, itself predicting more positive attitudes toward the partner.

In order to accomplish this objective, an empirical study was conducted with 416 students from two universities, organized into groups of 4 or 5 students, who were instructed to complete a collaborative project over the course of one semester. At the end of the project, the students filled out a questionnaire and the resulting data was analyzed using the partial least squares (PLS) technique. The results suggest that social presence and teacher-student interaction have a positive influence on students’ active learning, both directly and indirectly, through emotional engagement. This variable also mediates the influence of student-student interactions, which have a less significant impact on active learning than the other analyzed variables. Consequently, this study offers important contributions to the study and practice of active learning in a SWBCL environment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Computer-mediated communication; Cooperative/collaborative learning; Higher education; Interactive learning environments; Teaching/learning strategies,Artificial intelligence; Cooperative communication; Distributed computer systems; E-learning; Least squares approximations; Students; Teaching; Websites; Computer mediated communication; Cooperative/collaborative learning; Higher education; Interactive learning environment; Teaching/learning strategy; Computer aided instruction

This paper highlights a tension between moves towards collaborative learning and UK disabilities legislation in relation to learners with AS. Employing a qualitative case-study methodology, the investigation revealed how a technology-enhanced learning intervention afforded an AS-diagnosed learner greater opportunities to participate in groupwork in a higher education context. The findings suggest that not only can computer-mediated communications afford AS-diagnosed learners opportunities to participate meaningfully in group-work, but also that the learner demonstrated higher levels of collective-inclusive versus individual-exclusive phraseology than neurotypical peers, thereby challenging assumptions around participation in collaborative learning activities and assimilation of peer-feedback. © 2015 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).",Asperger’s syndrome; Autistic spectrum; Collaborative learning; Computer-mediated communication; Technology-enhanced learning,

This issue requires investigation into the drivers that affect undergraduate intentions and behaviour when using Facebook as students of private universities in Malaysia. The technology acceptance model (TAM) is adopted to demonstrate student perceptions of using Facebook for learning. Perceived enjoyment and self-efficacy are also integrated into the research framework to offer a deep understanding about the acceptance and use of new technologies. The determinants analysed are perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived enjoyment and self-efficacy. Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) is used to analyse the data. The results show that all determinants have significant positive relationships with intention and behaviour to use, except for perceived usefulness. The research findings offer valuable and helpful implications that will contribute to universities, educational developers and academics regarding the effective use of Facebook for learning.

The impetus for the study came from the well-established effectiveness of community-based learning, a need for understanding learning design and analytics within networked structures and, the lack of theoretical grounding for social network analysis (SNA) in previous literature. Our study uses the Integrated Methodological Framework (IMF) which employs SNA as the key methodology for exploring community-based learning in light of the Communities of Practice (CoP) and Community of Inquiry (CoI) frameworks. The course comprised of three differently designed successive discussion forums spanning three weeks each. Network diagrams and SNA measures clearly showed the impact of the different learning designs on student engagement in the discussion forums. Based on CoP and CoI structural components within the IMF, a comparative analysis of whole-network properties of the three networks indicated the formation of a CoP, initiated and mediated by the tutor in discussion 1, sustained by the students in discussion 2, and disintegrated due to lack of guidance and facilitation in discussion 3. Qualitative analysis on the content of discussion posts revealed the importance of group oriented messages in the formation of the CoP.

(2) The registered group delivered more threads and wrote richer vocabulary in post content. (3) Whether students were registered for a course or not did not have a significant effect on their emotional expressions, but the registered group exhibited more confusion in forum interactions at the end of the semester.

This study presents primary data about perceptions of, and experiences with, online learning in an Australian university from a survey of 289 distance education (DE) students. Epistemologically, it prioritises giving agency and voice to an increasingly disempowered collective, online learners, who often are institutionally pursued for economic advantage, rather than pedagogical interest in serving students’ unique, individual needs/preferences. Participants’ comparison of face-to-face and online learning experiences allowed for benefits and disadvantages of online learning to emerge from lived-experiences. While a key benefit of online learning was its perceived ‘flexibility’, findings revealed difference between students’ conceptualisation of flexibility and institutional realities. Although DE students longed for non-technologically-medicated communication with peers and lecturers, the process of learning how to become a DE student failed to address students’ needs/concerns beyond technical skill acquisition and subject content mastery. Students’ ‘fear they were missing out’ (FOMO) on ‘better’ internal classroom and learning experiences was a key limitation 85% perceived about DE. Whereas traditional classroom experiences generally were recalled favourably, online learning was described by its shortcomings. Findings demonstrate need for deeper investigation of how/why educational technologies are implemented. Conclusions suggest critical research investigating whether embedded technologies meet student and/or institutional needs and aspirations in globally competitive learning environments may assuage DE’s stigma, realign expectations and improve teaching/learning experiences. © 2017, The Author(s).",Computer-mediated communication; Distance education; Isolation; Learning preferences; Online learning,

Online learning offers a promising way to provide meaningful, in-depth diversity and inclusion education to faculty and staff who typically have limited time to devote to professional development activities. However, little is known about the effectiveness of such learning interventions. The current project utilized a pretest-posttest design to examine the effectiveness of a 4-week instructor-led web-based course facilitated on Blackboard Learning Management System. Effectiveness was defined as increasing participants' cultural competence in terms of cognitive, affective, and behavioral learning related to building a more inclusive campus environment. The findings of this study provide initial evidence for the use of this online course to support the development of faculty and staff cultural competence. Results indicate that participants developed a greater understanding of the value of diversity, an increased openness to learning about other cultures, and a greater awareness of their social privileges. Results also suggest that individuals' geographic background and comfort level with computer-mediated communication moderate the effectiveness of the course in terms of learning outcomes. Finally, qualitative data from the open-ended questions help support the quantitative analyses and provide a richer understanding of participants' experiences and learning in the online course.

Despite this, there is limited evidence of how their use affects student learning within this context. This study focuses on the use of a tablet by the instructor to support the annotation and in-class sharing of students' work to create a collaborative learning environment within a first year undergraduate subject. This paper reports the results of an empirical study looking at the effect this tablet technology has on student performance using a sample of 741 first-year accounting students. The study uses data from enrolment and attendance records, end of semester examination results and student perceptions from a survey. Results indicate that class sharing of the instructor's and students' annotation of homework through the use of a tablet is associated with an improvement in student performance on procedural or equation-based questions as well as increased student engagement. However, contrary to expectations, the introduction of in class annotations was associated with a decline in student performance on theoretical, extended response questions. The authors argue that affordances of the tablet, when used in a student-centred way, can introduce a bias towards some kinds of interactions over others. This large-scale study of in-class tablet use suggests that though the tablets may be positively associated with student engagement and satisfaction, caution must be exercised in how the use by the instructor affects the classroom environment and what students learn.

Research suggests that it could facilitate the acculturation process. However, the mechanisms through which such facilitation take place are still under-investigated. This study examined the role of perceived social support from home/host country as mediators through which home/host SNSs use were associated with international students' acculturative stress. By surveying international students in a large American university (N = 322), the study found that (1) both perceived social support from home and host country were related to less acculturative stress; (2) SNS use with host national was associated with less acculturative stress through the increased level of social support from host country; (3) SNS use with distant and local conational was related neither to perceived social support from home country nor to acculturative stress. Among the control variables, we also found that (1) non-SNS mediated communication (i.e., email, text messages, and phones calls) with distant conational as well as face-to-face communication with local conational were related to less acculturative stress through the increased level of social support from home country; (2) non-SNS mediated communication with host national was associated with less acculturative stress through the increased level of perceived social support from host country.

Materials and methods: This was a questionnaire study in which all of the respondents in the survey are undergraduate students in Taiwan. A total of 222 (114 male and 108 female) students were selected as survey subjects. Researchers used partial least squares (PLS) regression and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to evaluate the measurement model and the quality of measures. Data collection tools were the Self-Regulated Learning at Work Questionnaire and the Theory of Planned Behavior Questionnaire. Results: Structural equation modeling was used to test research hypotheses. All the hypotheses tests showed that there was a positive and significant relationship between forethought of SRL and TPB. But, the relationship between attitude toward the behavior and behavioral intention was not significant. Additionally, the salient role of self-efficacy, goal setting, and task interest in generating planned behavior for participating in MOOCs was identified. Overall, self-efficacy, goal setting, and task interest were strong prediction variables for the proposed theoretical model.

However, results of research on the value of technological tools and blended courses in various academic disciplines are not consistent and only point to minimal effects on academic achievement. To fill this gap, in this study, participation in optional electronic quizzes and its effects on exam grades in large statistics classes depending on gender and previous statistics- and mathematics-related abilities are investigated. Overall, participation in the electronic quizzes yielded a positive effect on final grades. However, particularly the groups who participated less in the electronic quizzes – i.e. poor performing students and males - benefitted more from quiz participation than high performing and female students. The large variability in effect sizes of feedback on performance suggests that additional moderators such as specific situation- and task-related characteristics and individual affective preconditions such as effort, motivation, and self-esteem should be analyzed in future research. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Applications in subject areas; Business and economics statistics; Computer-mediated communication; Feedback; Gender studies; Post-secondary education; Teaching/learning strategies,Computer aided instruction; Economics; Feedback; Online systems; Students; Teaching; Applications in subject areas; Business and economics; Computer mediated communication; Gender studies; Postsecondary education; Teaching/learning strategy; E-learning

Alharbi M.A.,Patterns of EFL learners' and instructor's interactions in asynchronous group discussions on free writing,2018,Journal of Information Technology Education: Research,1,10.28945/4143,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058654573&doi=10.28945%2f4143&partnerID=40&md5=2241954791a6e94a6ac5d0bc0c6c416a,"Aim/Purpose The aim of the present study was to examine peer interactions and the instruc-tor's facilitation of online asynchronous group discussions on free writing among 20 learners of English as a foreign language (EFL) joining one Saudi university over one academic semester. The study also attempted to explore the views of the learners on the online interactions. Background Peer interaction has been one of the interesting topics for research on the appli-cations of computer mediated communication (CMC) tools among learners in different domains, including language learning and writing. However, most of the EFL classroom practices lack such peer interactions and are dominated by teach-er-centered approaches. Moreover, although CMC tools serve as interactive plat-forms for online peer interaction, such interaction needs to be cultivated and maintained by instructors. Methodology The study was conducted among 20 learners of English as a foreign language (EFL) in one Saudi university over one academic semester. The instructor of the writing course facilitated the asynchronous group discussions of free writing. The data was collected from (l) learners' peer interactions, (2) instructor's comments in the discussions and (3) learners' follow-up individual interviews. A qualitative content analysis of online interactions and a thematic analysis of the students' responses to the interview questions were performed. Contribution The use of technology reported in this study maximizes the opportunities for teacher-learner and learner-learner interactions, which are restricted or almost lacking in the EFL writing classroom. The findings of the present study also con-tribute to previous research on learners' peer interactions and instructors' facilita-tion of asynchronous group discussions. More specifically, the study informs us of the role of peer interactions through asynchronous tools in language learning, including writing. It also highlights the role of instructors in facilitating asynchro-nous group discussions. Findings The findings showed that the EFL learners posted 1702 comments distributed among eleven patterns in terms of its language functions: evaluation, problem identification, alterations, clarification, suggestion, justification, agreements and disagreements, comprehension check, procedural, error acknowledgement and others. Analysis of the foci of peer interactions illustrated that the learners en-gaged in task-oriented interactions: content, organization, purpose, grammar, vo-cabulary and spelling and punctuations and non-task-oriented interactions: task management and socialization. Based on the analysis of the instructor's com-ments, the instructor played an important role in facilitating the group discussions as indicated through his various comments (n=852) on the learners' discussions. Although the learners expressed their positive views on the role of peer interac-tions and learner-instructor interactions in enhancing language learning, including writing, grammar and even reading, some of them were challenged by the flow of online interactions, weak net connection and sensitivity to peer feedback. Recommendations for Practitioners The findings of the study provide valuable recommendations to both learners and instructors who are interested in using asynchronous tools for language learn-ing and, in particular, writing through interactions. The application of such tools is promising, and its value is maximized with instructor's facilitation of peer inter-actions. Recommendations for Researchers The study provides valuable insights into how peer interactions and instructor's comments are both important when investigating asynchronous group discus-sions in EFL learning. Therefore, researchers should search this interesting re-search topic further to enrich our knowledge of it. Impact on Society Since the study focuses on one country of the EFL context, it is expected to have an impact on the society, particularly university learners and instructors by raising their awareness of the role of technological applications in learning and teaching. Future Research Future researchers should focus on how peer interactions are distributed among individual learners and how the instructor's facilitation affects peer interactions in asynchronous group discussions over time. © 2018, Informing Science Institute.",Asynchronous tools; EFL writing; Instructor's facilitation; Peer interaction,Breath controlled devices; Data mining; Online systems; Computer mediated communication; English-as-a-Foreign-Language; Instructor's facilitation; Learning and teachings; On-line interactions; Peer interactions; Problem identification; Technological applications; Learning systems

This study approached IM as an out-of-class communication (OCC) approach in computer-mediated communication. The purpose of this paper is to investigate students’ perceived quality of information received and its influence on their perceived performance proficiency as a result of their lecturers’ clarification of their enquiries through an online instant message application, namely Remind (www.remind.com/). Design/methodology/approach: The target groups were first-year business students in an international university in Vietnam. The analysis of the data gathered from the questionnaire was carried out using a measurement model and a structural equation model. Findings: The findings indicate that using OCC technology creates social bonding between students and lecturers by allowing students to clarify the ambiguity of concepts learnt in class and create a sense of connection with their lecturers which leads to better student engagement and hence improved learning outcomes.

University students (n = 312) were asked to evaluate three counseling channels (i.e., traditional face-to-face, internet, and SL) based on a range of media features deemed relevant and important to counseling and to assess their relative preferability when faced with different counseling problems. For the purposes of this study, counseling rooms with different styles were built, virtual counselors with different genders, ages, and styles were created, and short video recordings of scripted counseling sessions were produced in SL. For the media feature comparisons, the collected data were analyzed by the multivariate analysis of variance, followed by the analysis of variance and post hoc comparisons when significant differences were found, whereas for counseling problem comparisons, repeated-measure analysis of variance and post hoc comparisons were used. The results for the media feature comparisons showed that SL counseling significantly out-rated traditional counseling in all of the examined media features, with the exception of the interactivity dimension. Additionally, while SL and internet counseling were both perceived as significantly better than traditional counseling in areas that are unique to computer-mediated communications, including anonymity, convenience, and flexibility with regard to time and space, as well as privacy of the counseling site, SL was perceived as distinctly superior to internet counseling in five areas due to its unique affordances, including the choice of appearance, choice of counselors, interactivity, diversity of counseling sites, and availability of counseling object dimensions. Furthermore, traditional counseling was regarded as better able to support more fluent and versatile interaction between the counselor and client than the other two computer-mediated channels. As for the results of counseling problem comparisons, SL was rated as least preferred for six out of the seven counseling problems (except for gender identity issues), despite its media affordances.

Leaders engage in important community activities such as encouraging members and building social structure. These potential benefits, however, have rarely been empirically tested. We were presented with an opportunity to explore this issue while studying an online board-and-card-game community. During our study, the community experienced a major change in leadership when the founder – and formal leader – decided to substantially reduce his involvement in the site. This provided us with the rare opportunity to carry out a case study of leadership reduction in a real-world community. To look at the effects of leadership on community behaviour, we analysed 16 months of activity logs, supported by interviews, to compare the community before, during, and after the founder’s withdrawal. We observed strong variability in the effects of a leadership reduction – some results were in line with the “leadership hypothesis,” but others were unexpected. In some cases, we found evidence that reducing formal leadership can have negative effects on the success of the community; but in other cases, we found surprising sources of resilience to the reduction in leadership activities. Our study is the first to look at the details of how leadership (and a reduction in this role) affects several types of sub-community within a board-and-card game site, and the first to consider some of the factors that lead to differences in the effects of leadership reduction. Overall, we found that negative effects on sub-communities were closely tied to the specific activities that the leader provided, and the degree to which he was the only person able to provide those roles. The broad strokes of this finding agree with the leadership hypothesis, but there are several unexpected elements within the main story: the negative effects were less drastic than we anticipated, and all of the sub-communities (even the most dependent) survived the transition. The strong resilience of some of the sub-communities seems to be connected to their ability to “fall back” to a foundation of shared activity (i.e., game play) – an idea that has been introduced in earlier work but never studied empirically. This research helps designers to understand the complexities of leadership in online communities, providing an important foundation for developing and supporting online groups. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Board and card games; Case study; Leadership change; Online games; Online leadership; Virtual community,Virtual reality; Card games; Leadership change; On-line games; Online leadership; Virtual community; Social networking (online)

The current study investigated the inclusion of emoticons as a method through which to enhance student perceptions of the accessibility and emotionality of written online assessment feedback. Undergraduate students (N = 241) were presented with an online faux essay along with associated written feedback typical of the comments students would receive in the higher education context. The feedback was identical except for the inclusion of emoticons. Using a between-groups design, emoticons were manipulated in two ways: frequency (none, 1, 3, or 6) and valence (happy, sad, or confused). The use of happy emoticons produced significantly higher perceptions of marker warmth when compared to no emoticons, or when negatively valenced emoticons were included. Furthermore, marker competence was significantly higher when 3 happy face emoticons were presented in the feedback than when 3 sad or confused faces were included. Student perceptions of feedback quality and marker professionalism were not affected by emoticon use. Thus, the results suggest that instructors can use positively valenced emoticons to inject some fun, warmth, and emotionality in written online assessment feedback without sacrificing feedback quality or professional integrity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Computer-mediated communication; Evaluation methodologies; Pedagogical issues; Post-secondary education; Teaching/learning strategies,Behavioral research; Computer mediated communication; Evaluation methodologies; Pedagogical issues; Postsecondary education; Teaching/learning strategy; Students

Yet, little is known about how students' task-on and task-off Internet, as well as social media use, may influence their perceived academic performance. This study differentiates task-related and non-task-related compulsive Internet use and utilizes academic type of social media activity that predicts perceived academic performance with inclusion of task value as external variable and academic motivation as moderator. The SEM analysis of data collected from 489 Turkish students shows that academic type of social media activity and task-related compulsive Internet use positively impact perceived academic performance, while non-task-related compulsive Internet use negatively influences perceived academic performance. Perceived academic performance positively predicts task-related compulsive Internet use of students with a moderation effect of academic motivation. Another interesting finding is that perceived task value positively influences perceived academic performance in the context of non-task-related compulsive Internet use but not task-related compulsive Internet use, which is explained to the extent that the type of Internet use defines whether students value the process of learning (e.g., online searching of study materials, resources, academic contents)or the outcome (e.g., academic grades)mostly. Findings can help educators to lead the students to appropriately use Internet and social media for academic purpose. Because, academic motivation can significantly contribute to students' use of Internet for academic purpose regardless of their need for relief, comfort in case of bad academic performance and grades. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Computer-mediated communication; Human-computer interface; Interactive learning environments; Media in education,Human computer interaction; Motivation; Social networking (online); Students; Academic motivations; Academic performance; Computer mediated communication; Human computer interfaces; Interactive learning environment; Media in education; Positive and negative effect; University students; Computer aided instruction

Despite this, there is limited evidence that lecture recordings affect student attendance or attainment, and so it is not clear why lecture recording is considered so disruptive. An evaluation was run in a large Russell Group Institution in the UK in 2018 as it rolled out an institute-wide lecture recording programme. In this study, in-depth interviews with 13 staff members and free-text responses from 159 first-year student survey respondents were analysed using constructivist grounded theory to explore why lecture recording is viewed as disruptive, and what the implications of this are for teaching. Both staff and students were concerned with issues which happened inside the classroom (proximate) and wider issues about education (ultimate issues), but these concerns manifested differently between the groups. Overall, the act of recording a space was considered transformative, creating a digital artefact which was both highly valued by students as a ‘tool’ to improve their learning, but impacting on the overall ‘show’ that lecturers felt was a core aspect of the lecture. Ultimately, staff were also concerned that recordings ‘canonised’ the material, and made students too reliant on lectures, whereas students viewed the recordings as a safety net. The implications of this transformative power of recording for teaching are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Computer mediated communication; Evaluation of impact; Lecture capture; Lecture recording; Media in education,Education computing; Surveys; Computer mediated communication; Evaluation of impact; Lecture capture; Lecture recording; Media in education; Students

The participants were 14 pre-service teachers taking an intercultural course for English teachers at a Russian university. For three weeks, they engaged in a multicultural out-of-class telecollaboration with 14 pre-service teachers pursuing an MA degree in foreign language education in the U.S. English was used as a means of interaction. The Russian participants’ uses and views regarding the telecollaboration project were gathered through a mixed-method analysis of their oral posts, online questionnaire responses, a whole-class discussion, and individual reflections. The results revealed that the pre-service teachers appreciated the format, timeframe, and facilitation of the project as well as the affordances mediated by the voice-based tool for enabling them to develop their intercultural skills with multicultural partners. The results also indicated that, to maximize student engagement, it is important to consider learners’ contextual variables, and their individual preferences and needs when choosing CMC tools and telecollaboration partners. The study concludes with a number of pedagogical suggestions for teachers interested in conducting projects that can raise their students’ intercultural awareness via telecollaboration tools. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",intercultural learning; learner perspectives; task design; Telecollaboration; voiced-CMC tools,

The research was based on a sample of 1237 digital interactions in discussion forums and emails between students of the National University of Distance Learning on subjects related to academic work. We applied a descriptive quantitative methodology by means of a statistical and lexicometric analysis of the written texts and multiple regression analysis, related to four independent variables: gender, studies, interlocutor (professor/student), and digital device (fixed, mobiles) and three orthographic sub-levels (punctuation, accentuation and spelling). The results show that there is considerable room for improvement in the orthography of university students’ asynchronous digital writing.

This study aims to investigate the factors that influence student adoption of cloud computing in higher education settings and to generate a set of decision rules to guide through a series of critical decisions needed in this adoption process. Accordingly, a two-stage Structural Equation Modelling (SEM)-Classification and Regression Trees (CART) methodology is applied in order to test the overall research model and related hypotheses as well as to generate decision rules to predict behavioural intention towards adoption. Using survey questionnaire method, a total of 418 valid questionnaires are collected from students of top-ranked Malaysian universities. The results show that task-technology fit, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, self-efficacy, collaboration technology experience, peer and superior influence and familiarity with group members are significant predictors of intention to adopt cloud computing.

Different types of videoconferencing platforms or systems have emerged for use in today's higher education institutions. Previous research has focused on examining the potential of three different forms of videoconferencing systems: desktop videoconferencing (DVC), interactive videoconferencing (IVC), and Web videoconferencing (WVC). In this study, a review of the literature was conducted to increase the current knowledge regarding the use of these videoconferencing systems. A classification of the videoconferencing paradigms from the constructivism and cognitivism perspectives was provided. The summary of the results for these videoconferencing systems revealed specific learning opportunities, outcomes, and challenges for both learners and instructors. The results suggest that current policy and teaching strategies are not ready to provide an accessible and comprehensive learning experience in DVC and IVC. Relative to previously conducted studies regarding the use of videoconferencing in higher education, this study offers a broader consideration of relevant challenges that emerge when using certain videoconferencing systems in both learning and teaching situations. © 2019 Athabasca University.",Computer-mediated communication; Distance education; Improving classroom teaching; Lifelong learning; Telelearning,

Research and development in any nation are measured according to research outcomes, such as publications. Publications are becoming the primary source for evaluating academic staff and academic institutions. Knowledge is the most important resource in universities. Useful knowledge can improve the performance of workers in the organization. Knowledge sharing, or the exchange of information between workers, is important for academics and practitioners. Knowledge acquisition, knowledge sharing and knowledge utilization are three types of knowledge management. Higher education in Saudi Arabia seeks to enhance scientific research as a key component of developing the nation and its universities. In recent years, higher education in Saudi Arabia has initiated multiple projects on enhancing the research productivity of academic staff in Saudi universities. Saudi higher education is seeking to automate all research activities to enhance research performance. This study examines the impact of using knowledge sharing to improve scholarly publications from academic staff in Saudi universities. In addition, this research identifies the factors that lead to enhanced levels of knowledge sharing in Saudi universities. The researchers interviewed 22 academic staff from Taibah University and reviewed papers and academic institutions’ websites to identify the important indicators for measuring research productivity. Responses to an online questionnaire from 374 academic staff in Saudi universities were used to determine the relation between knowledge sharing and scholarly publication and to examine the factors that enhance knowledge sharing in Saudi universities. This study used SmartPLS to analyse the results. The results show that computer-mediated communication and nature of knowledge are the primary factors that positively affect knowledge sharing in Saudi universities, and scholarly publications are the primary indicator for measuring research productivity. In addition, knowledge sharing and computer-mediated communication significantly enhance research productivity at Saudi universities. © 2018",Key performance indicators; Knowledge sharing; Saudi universities; Scholarly publications; SmartPLS,Benchmarking; Knowledge acquisition; Productivity; Publishing; Key performance indicators; Knowledge-sharing; Saudi universities; Scholarly publication; SmartPLS; Knowledge management; algorithm; higher education; information technology; knowledge; questionnaire survey; research and development; software; university sector; Saudi Arabia

In particular, we consider using Slack to support students’ peer interactions during Master’s thesis work. For this purpose, we designed a case study that was executed in a Master’s thesis seminar course. During the course, all out-of-class communication was carried out by using Slack, instead of e-mails or learning management systems. After the course, we used a questionnaire to investigate how the students perceived Slack for asking for assistance, their intention to use Slack, and Slack’s ease of use. Furthermore, the questionnaire asked feedback about challenges that the students found in slack. To examine the students’ peer support in Slack, we analysed the messages in the course’s public discussion channels. We investigated opportunities and challenges of Slack from instructional perspective by conducting an auto-ethnographic data collection. Our analysis revealed that the students perceived Slack as an easy-to-use communication tool with a low threshold of asking questions. The students also expressed high intentions to use Slack in the future. However, the students were worried of information overload in Slack, frustrated with decentralisation of communication tools in higher education, and cautious of using communication tools that are not officially supported by the university. The students’ interactions were assigned to three categories: practical, technical, and thesis-related. Analysis of these categories revealed that the students were able to explicate and solve issues in Slack, but the issues were only related to practical and technical problems, instead of actual Master’s thesis writing. The teacher perceived that Slack enhanced bi-directional communication with the students, but faced issues related to file management and user authentication. The results implicate that developing an alternative for Slack from educational premises could be more useful than a product that is not originally developed for pedagogical needs. Finally, we present recommendations that help educators to use Slack in their educational practices. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Communication tools; Computer-mediated communication; Higher education; Master’s thesis; Peer support; Slack,

Collaborative inhibition was present across both collaborative conditions. Individual recall in Recall 3 was higher when participants had previously collaborated in comparison to recalling three times individually. There was no difference between face-to-face and parallel CMC recall, however subsidiary analyses of instance repetitions and subjective organisation highlighted differences in group members' approaches to recall in terms of organisation and attention to others' contributions.

This article parts from Fairclough’s (1995) premises to analyse how this phenomenon is taking place in Romance languages with a similar technological development in comparison to the discourse practices of a country where the penetration of the Internet in the everyday life of its inhabitants is merely symbolic. The study thus compares the level of informalization of the public discourse in Cameroon, France and Spain by studying the welcoming letters of the principals of universities to their students published on the official websites of these higher institutions. We see the formality and informality of greetings, sign-offs and signatures of letters as well as the use of the second person pronoun as clear parameters that can confirm the tendency towards informalization in present public discourse. The results have shown that the discourse practices of these European university authorities are similar in their degree of informality, although there seems to be a stronger preference for informal styles in Spain. The results also confirm that the low penetration of the Internet must have a decisive influence on the fact that the discourse practices in Cameroonian universities follow a very traditional style with very formal salutations and farewells and a very formal use of signatures and pronouns, since most welcoming letters have not been written for the web, unlike the letters published on the French and Spanish websites. We understand the limitations of the study, which are clearly provoked by the poor access of Cameroonians to the Internet and have restricted our study to the official webpages of universities. However, we hope that this novel analysis of Cameroonian Computer-mediated Communication discourse (CMC) can serve as a point of departure for similar studies on CMC in technologically under-developed societies, but, above all, we wish this piece of research to enrich the field of linguistic studies in Romance languages. © 2018 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

The second aim was to determine how the results of this study should be taken into consideration at Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) in curriculum development. The analyses employed in this survey followed Media synchronicity theory (MST), originally proposed by Dennis/Valacich (1997) and later refned by Dennis et al. (2008). This study was conducted using a mixed method approach with data from a quantitative survey regarding media usage of 274 respondents and qualitative theme interviews of fve working life representatives. The fndings indicate that the choice of media varies between different countries and is dependent on the different capabilities and synchronicity of the media. The team structure, communication processes, choice of language, cultural diversity and ethical rules of the company play an important role in communication and are meaningful when choosing the media for communication. The main conclusion is that the ability to choose the media that is suitable for varying communicative situations in working life has become essential and therefore needs to be developed as part of curriculum development work at HEIs.",Computer-mediated Communication (CMC); ELF; Higher education; Media choice; Working life communication,
Ko C.-J.,The effect of task types on foreign language learners' social presence in synchronous computer mediated communication (SCMC),2016,JALT CALL Journal,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85005950516&partnerID=40&md5=01b48a552b15b8d9dd0907a048f219c4,"This study aims to clarify the relationship between task types and foreign language learners' social presence (sp) in text-based scmc learning modes. The participants in this study comprised 38 high-intermediate level English as a foreign language (efl) learners from different disciplines of a university in Taiwan. They were divided into two groups (text-chat without webcam, text-chat with webcam). The task types selected for this study included jigsaw tasks (jts) and decisionmaking tasks (dmts). The empirical data for this study were collected from students' sp surveys, interview transcripts, learning journals, and online discussion records. The findings of this study suggest that the task types could affect efl learners' sp development in scmc. The dmts in this study enhanced learners' sp development better. In addition, the learners' image provided by the webcam seemed to enhance learners' sp perception. The learners perceived the highest sp in the dmt-webcam condition, and the lowest sp in the jt-nonwebcam condition. However, the learners did not recognize the advantage of the webcam image. Therefore, it is highly recommended that learners be trained to adapt to learning environments in order to enhance sp before the start of learning. © 2016 jalt call sig.",Computer-mediated communication; Decision-making task; Jigsaw task; Social presence,

Communities of practice (CoP) with academic support in the wings could benefit students, but little is known in the about their use in the undergraduate space, or how best they may be structured and facilitated (Andrew et al., 2008). The purpose of this paper is to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – An online CoP was created in partnership with undergraduate bachelor of midwifery students at the University of South Australia using an action research model. This provided an ongoing ability to continuously plan, act, observe and evaluate all aspects of the community created, so that adjustments could be made during the two cycles of the study. Findings – The time paucity of the cohort impacted on their ability to participate fully as partners in the project, and in the community itself. The Facebook community received more visitation than the Weebly community. The student panel reported that despite the online CoP fitting better with their schedules, they would prefer more opportunities to interact face to face with their peers. Research limitations/implications – Students who spend limited time on campus may prefer more real life social contact and support, despite the convenience of an online community. A larger cohort, drawing from a non-professional degree would have allowed greater membership and community participation for a prospective study such as this. Practical implications – Remote study is a growing phenomenon, and students need to feel socially connected and supported to remain enroled and engaged. Social implications – There has been much discussion around the amount of time individuals spend online, and whether support groups formed by students on social media support student learning, or encourage unprofessional behaviours without academic support present. Originality/value – This study reports that online communities are not always a logical solution to time poor students, and they may prefer face to face interactions to build their social and professional relationship. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Community of practice; Facebook; Learning community; Midwifery; Online; Undergraduate,
Mykota D.B.,Replication study on the multi-dimensionality of online social presence,2015,Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84920096624&partnerID=40&md5=9669dd17b98dba62f05fa4e9cc6effc0,"The purpose of the present study is to conduct an external replication into the multi-dimensionality of social presence as measured by the Computer-Mediated Communication Questionnaire (Tu, 2005). Online social presence is one of the more important constructs for determining the level of interaction and effectiveness of learning in an online environment. This study is unique as it provides the opportunity to replicate previous research on the dimensionality of the instrument and offers insight as to the nature of social presence among students enrolled in higher education postgraduate online courses. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.",Online learning; Replication analysis; Social presence,
